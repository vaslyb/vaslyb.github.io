I am a Ph.D. student in the field of Symbolic AI and Deep learning. I aim to combine classical artificial intelligence techniques with new state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to build interpretable and robust AI  models. My goal is depicted in my current work where I combine knowledge graphs and machine learning models (XGBoost, Support Vector Machine) with deep learning models in order to solve categorization tasks. I also have some familiarity with the process of creating datasets, a research that is crucial for the development of trustworthy AI models.
