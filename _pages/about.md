I am a Ph.D. student in the field of Symbolic AI and Deep learning. I aim to combine classical artificial intelligence techniques with new state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to build interpretable and robust AI  models. My goal is depicted in my current work where I combine knowledge graphs and machine learning models (XGBoost, Support Vector Machine) with deep learning models in order to solve categorization tasks. I also have some familiarity with the process of creating datasets, a research that is crucial for the development of trustworthy AI models.  


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
